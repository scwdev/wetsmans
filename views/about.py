    "Transitioning to full-time work in data science. As both a psychiatrist and business executive my life-long focus has been on helping people and organizations bring about change. Stories are so important in facilitating change that I wrote a book about them, and at the heart of every story is data. My career in Data Science began when I designed a novel portal/EHR/dashboard for addiction treatment that created an improved environment of care.
